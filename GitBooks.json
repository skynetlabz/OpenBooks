So you can fork that repository and get your own copy of this book to modify. If you make changes, you can send me a pull request so I can merge your changes into my version. That whole workflow is an essential part of why Git has become so popular for open-source projects, and a key purpose of this book is explaining that workflow and why it’s so powerful.",
